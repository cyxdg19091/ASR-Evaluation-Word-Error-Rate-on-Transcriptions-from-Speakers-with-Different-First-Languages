The Norse wind and the sun were disputing which was the stronger. When the traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak, they agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the Norse wind blowed as hard as he could, but the more he blow, the more closely did the traveler float his cloak around him. And at last, the Norse wind gave up the attempt, then the sun shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took off his cloak, and so the Norse wind was obligated to confess that the sun was the stronger of the two.
