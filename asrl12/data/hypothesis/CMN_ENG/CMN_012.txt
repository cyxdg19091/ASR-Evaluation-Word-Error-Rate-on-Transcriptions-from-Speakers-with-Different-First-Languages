The Northwind and the storm were disputing which was stronger. When the traveler came along, wrapped in his warm cloak. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the Northwind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blows, the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him. And the last, the Northwind gave up. The attempt. Then the song shined out warmly and immediately the traveler took off his cloak. And so the Northwind was obliged to confess that the song was stronger of the two.
