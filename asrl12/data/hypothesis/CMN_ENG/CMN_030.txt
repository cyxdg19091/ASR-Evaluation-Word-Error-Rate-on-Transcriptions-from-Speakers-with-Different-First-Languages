The North Wayne and the Sound were disputing which was the stronger. When a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak, they agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wayne blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew, the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him. And at last the North Wayne gave up the attempt. Then the Sound shined at warmly and immediately the traveler took off his cloak. And so the North Wayne was obliged to confess that the Sound was the stronger of the two.
