The lost wind and the sun were disputing which was stronger, when a trailer came along wrapped in a warm clock. They agreed that the one who was excited in making the trailer take a hit clock off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the lost wind blew as hard as it could, but the more it blew, the more colony did the trailer for the color of the colony. At this last, the lost wind gave it up at a time. Then the sun shined as a colony, and immediately the trailer took off its clock, and saw the lost wind as it objected to confess that the sun was stronger than the two.
