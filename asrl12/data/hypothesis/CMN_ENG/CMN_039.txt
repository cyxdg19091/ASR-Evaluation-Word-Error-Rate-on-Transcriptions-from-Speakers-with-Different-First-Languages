The Northwind and the Sun was disputing which was stronger. When a traveler came along, ramped in a warm clock. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler taking his clock off should be considered stronger than the other. The Northwind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew, the more closely did the traveler to fold his clock around him. And at last, the Northwind gave up with the attempt, then the Sun shined out warmly. And immediately, the traveler took off his clock, and so the Northwind was obliged to confess that the Sun was stronger or the two.
