The North wind and the Sun were built in which it was the drunkard. When a traveler came along wrapped in a warm clock, they agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his clock cough should be considered stronger than the other. There's a North wind blow as hard as he could, but the more he blew, the more closely the traveler thought his clock had run him. And at last, the North wind gave up the attempt. That's the sound shined out warmly and immediately the traveler took off his clock. And so the North wind was obliged to confide that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
