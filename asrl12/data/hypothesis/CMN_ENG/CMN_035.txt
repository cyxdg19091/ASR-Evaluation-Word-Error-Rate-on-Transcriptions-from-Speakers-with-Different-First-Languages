The Northwind and the Sun were disputing, which was stronger. When the Traveler came along, ramped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the Traveler take his cloak off, should be considered stronger than neither. The Northwind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew, the more closely did the Traveler for his cloak around him, and then lost the Northwind, gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the Traveler took off his cloak. And so the Northwind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.
