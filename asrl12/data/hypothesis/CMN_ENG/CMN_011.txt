The North Wing and the Sound were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wing blew as hard as it could, but the more he blew, the more closely did the traveler photos cloak around him. And at last, the North Wing gave up the attempt. Then the Sound shined out warmly, and immediately the traveler took of his cloak. And so the North Wing was obliged to confess that the Sound was the stronger of the two.
