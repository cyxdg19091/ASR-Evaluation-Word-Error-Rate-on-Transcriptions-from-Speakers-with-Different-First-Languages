The Norwin and the Stunns were disputing which was the stronger when the travelers came a known web in a warm clock. They agreed that the one who first, the staff, in making the traveler take his cross off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the Norwin blew a heart as he could, but the more he blew, the more clueless the traveler flowed, he clocked along him. And at last, the Norwin gave up the attempt. Then the Stunns shied out warmly and immediately the traveler took off his cross. And so the Norwin worked up, lead up, lead to confess that the Stunns was the stronger of the two.
