The North wind and the sun were disbuilding which was the stronger. When a traveler came along wrapped in a warm coat. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his coat off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North wind blew as hard as he could. But the more he blew, the more closely did the traveler float his coat around him. And at last the North wind gave up the attempt. Then the sun shined out warmly. And immediately the traveler took off his coat. And so the North wind was blocked to confess that the sun was the stronger of the two.
