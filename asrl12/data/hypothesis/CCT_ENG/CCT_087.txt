The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger. When the Traveler came along, robbed an agwom cloak. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the Traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could. But the more that he blew, the more closely the Traveler flowed, felt his cloak around him. And at last, the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shined out warmly, and immediately the Traveler took off his cloak. And so the North Wind was oblicked to confess that the Sun was stronger of the two.
