The Northwind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm coat. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his clock off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the Northwind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew, the more closely did the traveler take his footies clock around him. And at last, the Northwind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shined up warmly and immediately then the Sun shined up warmly. And immediately the traveler took off his clock. And so the Northwind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger one of the two.
