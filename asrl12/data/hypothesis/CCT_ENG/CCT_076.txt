The North wind and the sun were disputing which was stronger, when the Traveler came along red in the wrong clock. They agreed that the one who first possessed in making the Traveler take his clock off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North wind blew as hard as he could. But the more he blew the more closely, the Traveler flew his clock along him. And at last, the North wind gave up the attempt. Then the sun shied out warmly and admitted the trees, the Traveler's attitude of his clock. And so the North wind was a village to confess the sun was the stronger of the two.
